# How-does-HIPEC-therapy-work-for-advanced-abdominal-cancers-

HIPEC means Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy. It’s a special cancer treatment used after removing visible tumors from the belly area. Once the surgeon takes out all tumors they can see, a warm chemo liquid is put directly inside the stomach area and moved around for about 1–2 hours. The heat helps the chemo kill cancer cells more powerfully than normal cold chemo. This treatment mostly helps in cancers like ovarian, colon, appendix, and other that spread inside the belly. HIPEC is not given through IV like usual chemo, so it stays more focused and has less effect on the rest of the body. Not everyone is a candidate, but in right patients it may increase survival and reduce cancer coming back.
